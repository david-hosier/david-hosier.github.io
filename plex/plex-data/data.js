The extraordinary combination of Kinji Fukasaku and Bunta Sugawara, along with new ideas and a strong touch of realism, created the sixth movie of the series that describes 'The War of Hiroshima Gangsters' which had lasted almost 30 years after World War II. It can be called the Japanese secret post WWII history. It focuses on the ugly, violent inside struggle of the Yamamori Group of 1959 in Kure City, Hiroshima. Director Kinji Fukasaku, the master of portraying violence and humanity, said \"Having making the five previous movies, I found those characters very interesting. So I took a deeper look into them this time.\" He made this shocking movie with high enthusiasm and revealed the core of gangster's struggle which has never been touched before.","studio":false,"genre":["Crime Fiction","Action film","Comedy"],"director":["Kinji Fukasaku"],"role":false,"media":{"bitrate":1001,"aspect_ratio":2.35,"audio_channels":2,"audio_codec":"mp3","video_codec":"mpeg4","video_resolution":0,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":734183424}},"471":{"key":471,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_471.jpeg","title":"New Battles Without Honor and Humanity 2: Boss's Head","duration":5613072,"view_count":0,"tagline":false,"rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":1975,"release_date":"1975-11-01","addedAt":1389242335,"content_rating":false,"summary":"The seventh in the shocking \"Jingi Naki Tatakai\" movie series, which exposes the true lives of the yakuza that is hidden by a mask of \"jingi\".

fall day in Canada, on a particularly mind-numbing second day of a drive from Calgary to Vancouver, after being nearly lost in snow oblivion the previous night driving an 8 hour stretch across the Canadian Rockies through a blizzard with a failing battery and faltering headlights, we had an idea. The idea was that Agency Group booked, label sponsored, magazine advertised, banner ad, corporate, package touring was fucking stupid. And that nearly dying to arrive at shows \u201con time\u201d (2 pm) to avoid a feeble complaint phone call from whichever headlining band\u2019s tour manager to our manager was not worth not being dead.\r\n\r\nWe remembered our first tours\u2026 Self-booked journeys that mainly involved staying with psychos, showing up to shows 30 minutes before we had to play, visiting national parks and historical locations during the day, and making friends with promoters and all the people who took the time to help us not because it was their job, but because they wanted to.\r\n\r\nWe were done playing to mentally retarded Gwar fans to \u201cexpand our fanbase\u201d. We started a band to play music, stay friends, see the world, and meet really beautiful, smart women. We hadn\u2019t toured internationally since our first self-booked tour to Europe 3 years before. No one in the music industry thought it made financial sense. We realized that since we hated all of those people anyway and thought they were painfully stupid, we should have never even taken their opinion into consideration. So we would go back to Europe, and go as far as we could, and to go to every country in the world that had ever emailed us asking us to come play a show. And to go to countries where no one had even asked, just because we wanted to see them if we could. We made a list of everywhere we wanted to go and everywhere we thought we could go on a napkin. We played 5 more shows, got home, went to Mexico for a week, kicked out Baby Horse, broke up with our girlfriends, called Jon Karel, and booked Earth Tour for 3 months straight.\r\n\r\nThe hell of booking this tour, finally, is not worth going into. The most that can be said is that it took David and Erik 3 months, 7 days a week, at least 8 hours a day, writing emails, researching immigration laws, looking up flight prices and weight regulations, figuring out the cheapest and most efficient routings, changing them at least 50 times, applying for credit cards and loans, researching electricity in 45 countries, trying to find reliable contacts, looking for publicity and sponsors, ordering merch in like 10 different countries, getting our CD released in 8 countries, restraining ourselves from flying to New York and murdering the employees of KOCH Records, responding to mean comments on message boards, developing a treatment for a reality TV show, having sex, renting movies on Netflix, meeting with production companies, tracking down a media team (Gary and Sarah- who we hung out with in Vancouver the night we thought of Earth Tour and who filmed and photographed this interview that night, weird), and getting vaccinated.\r\n\r\nIn the end our record label at the time, KOCH Records, dropped us after a bunch of fights over licensing our CD in foreign countries like China where there was no money to be made for them. We were very happy.\r\n\r\nWe maxed out 5 credit cards: 2 for the band, 2 of David\u2019s personal cards, 1 of Erik\u2019s, and took out a $10,000 loan. This totaled around $60,000 and covered all the flights we bought up front for the tour party of 7. Over the course of the tour we spent another $40,000 or so on merch, gas, drivers, hotels, ferries, equipment rental, food, souvenirs, and limousines. In the end we made just over $99,000. 45 countries, 4 continents, in 3 months, at a cost of around $100 per member.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to New York City we put $30,000 cash in 22 currencies into a paper lunch bag and took the subway to Bank of America.","studio":false,"genre":false,"director":false,"role":false,"media":{"bitrate":1160,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"audio_codec":"aac","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":0,"video_framerate":"NTSC","total_size":5631903297}},"1811":{"key":1811,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_1811.jpeg","title":"Immolation: Bringing Down the World","duration":2673360,"view_count":0,"tagline":false,"rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2004,"release_date":false,"addedAt":1392594047,"content_rating":false,"summary":"","studio":false,"genre":false,"director":false,"role":false,"media":{"bitrate":2177,"aspect_ratio":1.33,"audio_channels":2,"audio_codec":"mp3","video_codec":"mpeg4","video_resolution":480,"video_framerate":"PAL","total_size":727334188}},"1808":{"key":1808,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_1808.jpeg","title":"Meshuggah: Alive","duration":5426176,"view_count":0,"tagline":false,"rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":false,"release_date":false,"addedAt":1392593374,"content_rating":false,"summary":"","studio":false,"genre":false,"director":false,"role":false,"media":{"bitrate":2306,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":0,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1564008950}}},"sorts":{"title_asc":[1810,1809,1758,1811,1808],"release_asc":[1808,1811,1758,1809,1810],"addedAt_asc":[1758,1808,1809,1810,1811],"rating_asc":[1808,1811,1758,1809,1810],"title_desc":[1808,1811,1758,1809,1810],"release_desc":[1810,1809,1758,1811,1808],"addedAt_desc":[1811,1810,1809,1808,1758],"rating_desc":[1810,1809,1758,1811,1808]},"genres":[]},"13":{"key":13,"type":"movie","title":"Music Clips","num_items":28,"items":{"1768":{"key":1768,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_1768.jpeg","title":"Burnt By the Sun -

Several days later, a Power of Veto competition is held, where six players (the HoH, the nominees, and three guests) attempt to win the Golden Power of Veto, which gives the bearer the power to \"veto,\" or cancel, one of the HoH's nominations, forcing the HoH to nominate someone else (other than the Veto bearer) for eviction. Then, in the weekly live eviction, the houseguests vote to send someone out of the house for good.

That may be easier said than done, considering that the two share the same interests, the same intellect, the same coffee addiction and the same eyes. Rory is more serious than Lorelai, but there are tendencies, especially in the love department, that clearly indicate she is her mother's daughter. From the beginning, this unique mother-daughter team has been growing up together. Lorelai was just Rory's age when she became pregnant and made the tough decision to raise her baby alone.\n\nGilmore Girls was the first series to make it to air supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund. An initiative between some of the nation's top advertisers and The WB, the program is intended to offer a greater array of compelling family programming on network television.
