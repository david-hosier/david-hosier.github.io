title: Webelos Den Naming
---

I've been told that it is customary for Webelos dens to choose a name and emblem. We will cease to be referred to by our den number and instead referred to by the name of our choosing. Along with a name, the den can choose an emblem. This is a small patch that will be worn in place of the den number patch.

I've narrowed the choice of names/patches down to six, which can be seen [HERE](/scouts/webelos/patrol-patches.pdf) (Eagle has been added to the PDF). Show these patches to your scout and then please fill out and submit [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/1uzVD0iYRFIXB59J3) to indicate your preferences. Please submit your responses no later than Friday August 19th.

From what I understand, technically these patches should only be worn on the tan uniforms. However, I have no issues with boys wearing them on the blue uniform too.
