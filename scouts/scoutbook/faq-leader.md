## <a name="view"></a>Q. How Do I Login and View My Den?

The video below shows how to login and view your den in Scoutbook. As noted in the video, you can view your den either via the Dashboard or via the Pack 735 link under "My Units." You should experiment with which view works best for you. I prefer to view my den under the pack link, but you might find the Dashboard works better for you.

## <a name="signoff"></a>Q. How Do I Sign Off Scout Requirements?

In Scoutbook, each requirement has a lifecycle of sorts. The adventure pages have a helpful key that indicates what the different states are.

Parents only have the ability to mark requirements as completed. Den leaders can mark itmes as completed, approved, and awarded. I like to ask parents to be active participants by marking requirements as complete as they complete them at home, but you may also find that your parents prefer to let you know they are finished, in which case you would sign them off. The video below demonstrates how to sign off on an individual scout's requirements. Note that when signing off on as a den leader, you should be approving them at the same time you mark them complete (the video shows how to do this).

Let's say you have a den meeting where you cover several requirements. The above method for signing off requirements would be tedious in this case. Thankfully Scoutbook provides a Quick Entry feature. The Quick Entry allows you to easily sign off any number of requirements for one or more scouts in your den. This is perfect for quickly and easily signing things off after a den meeting. Note that the Quick Entry is only available from the den page that is accessed via the Pack 735 page, and is not available via the Dashboard. This is one reason why I prefer that view of the den. The following video demonstrates use of the Quick Entry.

## <a name="approval"></a>Q. What is the Advancement Approval Workflow?

The pack purchases advancement awards once a month, typically the weekend prior to that month's pack meeting. It is the den leader's duty to ensure that all completed advancements are approved in Scoutbook prior to the cutoff date announced by the advancement chair. Each month, the advancement chair will communicate the cutoff date via the Committee mailing list. It's my advice to periodically check the Needs Approval Report to see if parents are signing things off at home and approve on an ad-hoc basis. It's also a good idea to give your parents a heads up to make sure they are signing things off as the deadline approaches for the month. The following video demonstrates the use of the Needs Approval Report, which is one of the most critical tools available to the den leader in Scoutbook.

After the cutoff time for approving completed adventures, the advancement chair will add all approved items into a purchase order which will be used to shop for all the necessary awards. At the pack meeting, awards will be disbursed to den leaders who will then hand the awards out to the boys at their earliest convenience.

Once the awards are handed out to the boys, those adventures need to be marked as awarded in Scoutbook. This can be done via the Needs Awarding Report on your den Reports link (video coming soon).

## <a name="uncomplete"></a>Q. How Do I "Uncomplete" a Requirement?

Below is a video I made for the Parent FAQ, but it is applicable for den leaders as well. The video demonstrates how to deal with undoing an action where you mistakenly approved something that should not have been approved.
