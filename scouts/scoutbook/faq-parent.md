## Q. Can I Approve My Scout's Requirements?

Yes! Parents are highly encouraged to help their den leader by marking any requirements done at home as complete. Requirements completed at den meetings will typically be entered by the den leaders, but you can enter those as well if the den leader forgets or needs help. See below for directions on how to do this.

When you login to Scoutbook and navigate to your son's page, you need to navigate to his Advancement page.

On the Advancement page, click on the rank that your son is currently working on.

You will then see the list of all the Adventures for that rank. Click on the Adventure containing the requirement you wish to mark as completed.

On the Adventure page you selected, you will see the list of requirements for that Adventure. Click the desired requirement to go that requirement's sign off page.

On the sign off page, you can set the date the requirement was completed, add notes, and even add photos. Enter at least a date and click the Save button to mark the requirement as completed.

Once requirements are marked as completed by a parent, they will show up in a report that is visible to your den leader that shows all the requirements that are pending approval. When all requirements for an Adventure are completed, your den leader will request that the awards for those Adventures be purchased by the pack. When the awards are purchased, they will be distributed to the den leader to hand out to the boys as soon as possible. Advancement awards are typically purchased once per month and given to the den leaders at pack meetings.
