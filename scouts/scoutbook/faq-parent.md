## <a name="what"></a>Q. What is Scoutbook?

Scoutbook is an online system for tracking Cub Scout (and other forms of scouting) advancement. In scouting, advancement tracking is the means by which leaders keep track of which requirements our scouts are completing on their way to earning their current year's rank. Scoutbook allows parents and leaders to sign off and approve requirements online, as well as provide extremely powerful tools to monitor a scout's progress.

## <a name="signoff"></a>Q. How Do I Sign Off My Scout's Requirements?

Yes! Parents are highly encouraged to help their den leader by marking any requirements done at home as complete. Requirements completed at den meetings will typically be entered by the den leaders, but you can enter those as well if the den leader forgets or needs help. See below for directions on how to do this.

When you login to Scoutbook and navigate to your son's page, you need to navigate to his Advancement page.

![Advancement Link](https://www.evernote.com/l/AASnGhtnSqNO_6nSnU2HHDD73dIOwY23VBIB/image.png)

On the Advancement page, click on the rank that your son is currently working on.

You will then see the list of all the Adventures for that rank. Click on the Adventure containing the requirement you wish to mark as completed.

On the Adventure page you selected, you will see the list of requirements for that Adventure. Click the desired requirement to go that requirement's sign off page.

On the sign off page, you can set the date the requirement was completed, add notes, and even add photos. Enter at least a date and click the Save button to mark the requirement as completed.

Once requirements are marked as completed by a parent, they will show up in a report that is visible to your den leader that shows all the requirements that are pending approval. When all requirements for an Adventure are completed, your den leader will request that the awards for those Adventures be purchased by the pack. When the awards are purchased, they will be distributed to the den leader to hand out to the boys as soon as possible. Advancement awards are typically purchased once per month and given to the den leaders at pack meetings.

**UPDATE** Here is a video I made showing this workflow. Note: Watch the video on YouTube.com or in fullscreen to see it more clearly.

## <a name="olddata"></a>Q. Why is My Scout Missing Old Advancement Information

If your scout is in a Wolf den or higher, you may notice that most or all of the data from previous years is not entered in the system. At the current time, there is no way to easily add all this old information. Well, I just found out that an enhancement to Scoutbook is imminent that will add automatic syncing with the official BSA online advancement tracking system. Allegedly, this will pull all old data that exists in the system into Scoutbook the first time it syncs, as well as keeping everything in sync after that. There may be some delay between the release date of this feature and our data being updated however, because there are very strict requirements on how our information is entered into Scoutbook in order for this sync to work properly. I will be working with our Membership Chair Kristen West to make sure we have all the data we need to get this working in a timely manner.
